          <p>
            There are 5 major snowboard shapes which all vary in size, weight,
            flex, and shape. "Freeride" boards are good for all snow conditions.
            "Freestyle" boards are playfull and for the park. "Powder" boards
            allow you to float over soft snow. "Split boards" are best for
            backcountry. And finally "All Mountain" boards are a perfect mix of
            everything.

          <p>
            Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer
            in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy for his daughter by fastening
            two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so she would have
            some control as she stood on the board and glided downhill.
